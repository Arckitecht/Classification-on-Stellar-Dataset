# Classification on Stellar Dataset

Stellar Classification uses spectral data of stars to categorize them into different categories. 
The modern star classification system is known as the Morgan-Keenan (MK) classification system. 
It uses the old HR classification system to categorize stars by their chromaticity and uses Roman 
numerals to categorize star size. In this dataset, we will use Absolute Magnitude and Color Index 
B-V to identify Giants and Dwarfs
