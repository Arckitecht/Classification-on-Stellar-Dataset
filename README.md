# Classification-on-Stellar-Dataset
Stellar Classification uses spectral data of stars to categorize them into different categories.  The modern star classification system is known as the Morgan-Keenan (MK) classification system.  It uses the old HR classification system to categorize stars by their chromaticity and uses Roman  numerals to categorize star size.
