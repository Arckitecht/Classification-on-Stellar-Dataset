# Classification on Stellar Dataset

Stellar Classification uses spectral data of stars to categorize them into different categories. 
The modern star classification system is known as the Morgan-Keenan (MK) classification system. 
It uses the old HR classification system to categorize stars by their chromaticity and uses Roman 
numerals to categorize star size. In this dataset, we will use Absolute Magnitude and Color Index 
B-V to identify Giants and Dwarfs. This dataset has several features of stars:

1. Vmag Visual magnitude of the star.
2. Plx Distance between the star and the Earth.
3. e_Plx Standard error of Plx.
4. B-V Color index (Hot stars have a B-V color index close to 0 or negative, while cold stars have a B-V color 5. index close to 2.0).
6. SpType Spectral type.
7. mag Absolute magnitude of the star.
8. TargetClass Determines whether the star is a dwarf (0) or a giant (1).

So, this dataset will determine the classification of a stellar or star, whether it is a giant or
a dwarf based on the available data features.
